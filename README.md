# dominion_rails
Dominion Rails 
===

This is a JRuby on Rails front-end for a full implementation of
the original Dominion card game. 

This project has been defunct for
many years and not likely to be resuscitated. It was a fun hack for me while
learning Ruby on Rails, but the code is here just for posterity. The
required image files have been omitted from the repository due to copyright.
